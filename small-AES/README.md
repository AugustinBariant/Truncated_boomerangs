Small-AES: Practical attacks on a 64-bit AES
======================================================================================

This directory contains an implementation of a small AES with 4-bit SBoxes,
and two boomerang attacks to verify our analysis:

- A 5-round distinguisher (boomerang5.c)
- A 6-round key recovery attack (boomerang6.c)
