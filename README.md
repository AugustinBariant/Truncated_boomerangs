There are three tools available in the repositiory:
1. Code for experimental verification of AES attacks on a small-scale variant of AES in the folder `small-AES`
2. A MILP tool to find boomerang attack parameters in the `MILP` folder
3. Code for experimental verification of the middle rounds of the Deoxys attacks proposed in the paper in the `Deoxys_verification` folder
