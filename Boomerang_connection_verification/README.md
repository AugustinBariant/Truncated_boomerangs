Boomerang Connectivity Experimental Verification
================================================


First, make sure that you have the OpenMP library installed.

Then, compile the C file corresponding to the version of your choice, using the Makefile. For instance, for the 13-round attack on Deoxys-BC, run

```sh
make deoxys_tk3_13
```

and evaluate the experimental probability by executing the generated binary:

```sh
./deoxys_tk3_13
```
